#  Virtual MQTT switches maintain state
#  over Home Assistant restarts. These switches
#  mainly enable or disable automations. All
#  switches have QOS = 1, which is guaranteed delivery
#  at least once. It is important that switch state
#  changes always are delivered.

#  Sleeping turns on when my phone plugs in
#  after a certain hour (via Tasker). It turns
#  off when an alarm goes off (also via Tasker).
#  Many automations depend on the state of this
#  switch in order to not interrupt sleep.
